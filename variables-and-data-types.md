# Variables and Data Types:


- Declaring variables (var, let, const).
- Primitive data types (number, string, boolean, null, undefined).
- Complex data types (objects, arrays, functions).

- Number: used for all number values (integer and floating point) except for very big integers.
- BigInt: used for arbitrarily large integers.
- String: used to store text.
- Boolean: true and false â€” usually used for conditional logic.
- Symbol: used for creating unique identifiers that won't collide.

- Null: indicating a deliberate non-value.
